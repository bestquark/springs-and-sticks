Here you can find the code for the project "Learning with springs and sticks". This project introduces an ML model based on a dissipative mechanical system composed of springs and sticks as shown below:

The main code can be found in the `src/` folder and the code for generating the paper's figures can be found in `paper_imgs/`. Animations and figures for this project can be found in the `anis/` and `figs/` folders, respectively.

A simple tutorial on the model is provided in the `springs_and_sticks.ipynb` file. This notebook contains minimal working examples of the model.

### Installation

To use this model, create a virtual environment and install the required packages by running
```
python -m venv springsenv
source springsenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
